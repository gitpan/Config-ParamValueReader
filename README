This package contains meathods for reading a basic config file into a hash.

This script will skip empty lines or lines starting with a semicolon (;) It will recognise anything after a semicolon as a comment on any line.

If only a parameter is specified it will be given a value of 1;

Multiple values can be specified by comma seperation

Names = "Bob",Ted,Mary,"Jane"


The Param = Value options will be read into a hash, the parameter is th ehash key and the value is an array.

If one value is specified it will be element 0 of the referenced array in the hash, if multiple values are specified they will be recognised as sequential elements of the array.
